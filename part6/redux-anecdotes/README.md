# Redux anecdoce

In this exercise, we made a new version of the anecdote voting application from part 1 using Redux. As a reminder, this application allows the user to vote between multiple anecdotes and then displays the most popular one.

This initial list of anecdotes is stored in the file db.json. This file is used by the tool JSON Server that acts as a backend server where the data are stored.
